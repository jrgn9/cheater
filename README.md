# CHEATER
A simple program for printing and managing cheat sheets to print in terminal. For those like me, who always forget commands and stuff. Inspired by [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) and [Cheaty](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/cheaty@centurix).

## ‚ö° Quick start

Gotta go fast

## üì• Install
Download the [latest version](https://github.com/jrgn9/cheater/releases/latest) or use git to clone the repo.

Run the `install.sh` script with sudo to automate the install. The script requires curl and rsync to function. It needs sudo privileges to symlink the program to /usr/local/bin. 

### Script install
```
chmod u+x /program_files/cheat

./install.sh
```

If you rather want to to a manual install follow the guide below. 

### Manual install
If you want to manually install the program follow these steps:

1. **Create a .cheater directory in /home/$USER:** `mkdir /home/$USER/.cheater`
2. **Copy the contents of the cheater directory with rsync or cp:** `rsync/cp .* /home/$USER/.cheater`
3. **Symlink the cheat program to $PATH. I prefer /usr/local/bin:** `sudo ln -s /home/$USER/.cheater/program_files/cheat /usr/local/bin/cheat`
4. **Give cheat the right permissions:** `sudo chmod u+x /home/$USER/.cheater/program_files/cheat`
5. **Check if it is installed correctly (you might have to restart your shell):** `cheat -h`

### Uninstall
I haven't created a script to do the uninstall. However, you simply need to delete the .cheater directory in home and remove the cheat symlink in /usr/local/bin

```
rm -rf /home/$USER/.cheater
rm /usr/local/bin/cheat
```
