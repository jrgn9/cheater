# CHEATER
A simple program for printing and managing your own cheat sheets to print in terminal. For those like me, who always forget commands and stuff. Inspired by [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) and [Cheaty](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/cheaty@centurix). Written in Bash.

## ‚ö° Quick start

Gotta go fast

## üì• Install
Download the [latest version](https://github.com/jrgn9/cheater/releases/latest) or use git to clone the repo.

Run the `install.sh` script with sudo to automate the install. The script requires curl and rsync to function. It needs sudo privileges to symlink the program to /usr/local/bin. You can also install it manually.

### Script install
The script requires rsync and curl to work properly!

Make sure the install script have execution rights, then run it:

```
chmod u+x install.sh

./install.sh
```
### Manual install
If you want to manually install the program follow these steps:

1. **Create a .cheater directory in /home/$USER:** `mkdir /home/$USER/.cheater`
2. **Copy the contents of the cheater directory with rsync or cp:** `rsync/cp .* /home/$USER/.cheater`
3. **Symlink the cheat program to $PATH. I prefer /usr/local/bin:** `sudo ln -s /home/$USER/.cheater/program_files/cheat /usr/local/bin/cheat`
4. **Give cheat the right permissions:** `sudo chmod u+x /home/$USER/.cheater/program_files/cheat`
5. **Check if it is installed correctly (you might have to restart your shell):** `cheat -h`

## üìù How to use

`cheat [name]` 

This command prints the cheat sheet in your terminal. For example `cheat vim` will print your vim cheat sheet.

`cheat [option] [name]`

Choose an option (add/edit/delete) and the name of the cheat sheet as a second argument. If you don't provide a name you will be prompted for one.

Add your own cheat sheets by using the `cheater --add` command. This creates and opens the cheat sheet in your default text editor (or nano as fallback).

Edit a cheat sheets by using the `cheater --edit` command. This opens a cheat sheet in your default text editor for editing.

Delete a cheat sheet by using the `cheater --delete` command. This removes a specified cheat sheet.

You can of course also add, delete and edit the files manually by going to the cheat_sheets directory.

### üß∞ Options

| \-a          | \--add       |  [file_name]            | Add a new cheat sheet. Provide name for the cheat. If there are no second argument, you will be prompted for a name |

| \-d          | \--delete      | [file_name]           | Delete a cheat sheet. Provide name for the cheat. If there are no second argument, you will be prompted for a name    |
| \-v          | \--version     |  | Prints version of the program |

### üöÆ Uninstall
I haven't created a script to do the uninstall. However, you simply need to delete the .cheater directory in home and remove the cheat symlink in /usr/local/bin

```
rm -rf /home/$USER/.cheater
rm /usr/local/bin/cheat
```
