# CHEATER
A simple program for printing and managing your own cheat sheets to print in terminal. For those like me, who always forget commands and stuff. Inspired by [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) and [Cheaty](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/cheaty@centurix). Written in Bash.
